  title={Melanin concentration gradients in modern and fossil feathers},
  author={Field, Daniel J. and DAlba, Liliana and Vinther, Jakob and Webb, Samuel M and Gearty, William and Shawkey, Matthew D.},
  journal={PLoS One},
  volume={8},
  number={3},
  year={2013},
  publisher={Public Library of Science},
  html={http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059451},

  abstract={In birds and feathered non-avian dinosaurs, within-feather pigmentation
  patterns range from discrete spots and stripes to more subtle patterns, but the
  latter remain largely unstudied. A ~55 million year old fossil contour feather with
  a dark distal tip grading into a lighter base was recovered from the Fur Formation
  in Denmark. SEM and synchrotron-based trace metal mapping confirmed that this
  gradient was caused by differential concentration of melanin. To assess the
  potential ecological and phylogenetic prevalence of this pattern, we evaluated 321
  modern samples from 18 orders within Aves. We observed that the pattern was found
  most frequently in distantly related groups that share aquatic ecologies (e.g.
  waterfowl Anseriformes, penguins Sphenisciformes), suggesting a potential adaptive
  function with ancient origins.}
