As an Assistant Professor at Mississippi State University (MSU), I am privileged to contribute to the academic excellence that defines this institution. In my role, I am dedicated to both teaching and research, nurturing a dynamic learning environment that encourages intellectual growth and curiosity. Through innovative curriculum design and engaging classroom practices, I aim to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed for success. My research pursuits further enrich MSU's academic landscape, contributing to the advancement of knowledge in my field and fostering a culture of inquiry and exploration. 

I am a highly motivated and dedicated interdisciplinary researcher focused on challenging complex, real-world problems; therefore, I want to pursue research at the intersection of renewable energy technologies, control theory, condition monitoring algorithms, and life cycle assessment. My goal is to enable the next generation of wind and tidal energy harvesting systems that operate reliably in increasingly unstructured, uncertain, and changing environments, and over long periods of time. I have been working on multiple projects on development of next-generation products of wind and tidal energy harvesting devices. My research interests center around structural dynamics and control, mechatronics, novel drivetrain design, control theory, condition monitoring algorithms, and life cycle assessment of system-level structures for renewable energy technologies.
